# California Airports with good food

This is a list of places where I have had good food at airports, or have heard rumours about good food. 
My idea is to try moving as many from the not tried, to the tried section


## Not tried Places

* KUKI - Tacos
* Lampson Field - BBQ
* KSAC - Diner is supposedly good
* KMRY - Terminal place is good they say
* KCVH
* KBSP
* KPRB
* Harris Ranch
* KAUN
* KCMA
* Little River
* Grass Valley - Drive to Nevada City
* NutTree - Fentons ice cream
* Oceano ( L52 )
