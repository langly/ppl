# Private Pilot Resources

This is a collection of various links to different resources I have found more
or less useful while studying for my PPL. If you feel that something is missing 
from this list, please raise an issue, or even better, create a pull request.

These links are meant as an addition to the standard books that most of us
should already be familiar with.

* [Pilotâ€™s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/)
* [Airplane Flying Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/media/airplane_flying_handbook.pdf)
* [FAR/AIM](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/faa_regulations/)

To me it seemed like the FAA books are quite good quick introduction to the
topics, but in order to really understand the topics enough for your PPL, some
more research is needed.

I'll read a lot more, and I will continue to update these links as I remember / revisit.

## Books

* [Mountain Flying Bible](https://www.mountainflying.com/products/mfbr_info.html) Gives a bit more practical approach to flying.
* [Stick and Rudder](https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Rudder-Explanation-Art-Flying/dp/0070362408) Old but good one. However, a very feel good book, more than technical.

## Engine/ Systems.

* [Smarter every day : Carburetor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toVfvRhWbj8&ab_channel=SmarterEveryDay) Interesting youtube video about carburetors
* [Antennas](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/students/presolo/special/antennas) Some pictures of the antennas you can expect to find on your plane

## Weather

* [AC 00-6B - Aviation Weather](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentid/1029851) This is required reading for the written.
* [AC 00-45 - Aviation Weather Systems](https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ac_00-45h.pdf) Explains all of the weather charts / metars you will encounter. Worthwhile browsing through so that no chart is unfamiliar

## Weights and Balance

* [Weight and Balance Handbook](https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/media/faa-h-8083-1.pdf) A bit more in-depth on Weight and Balance. besides what is mentioned in the Aeronautical Knowledge book.
